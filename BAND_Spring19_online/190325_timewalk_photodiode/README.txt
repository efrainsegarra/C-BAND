Time-walk corrections by fitting the standard y = A/Sqrt(x) + B to a plot of:
tdc meantime for a given bar - reference vs. Sqrt(ADC_L*ADC_R)
where reference is the laser photodiode.
The photodiode was plugged in the space that was occupied by V16-A
(which corresponds to sector: 3, layer: 6, component: 6)
